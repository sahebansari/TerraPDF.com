# Contributing to TerraPDF

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! This document explains how to get
started, what we expect from contributions, and how the release process works.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and welcoming. We will not tolerate harassment or
discrimination in any form.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later (the library
  targets .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10)
- Git

### Clone and Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraPDF.git
cd TerraPDF
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes. Keep commits focused and atomic.

3. Ensure all existing tests still pass and add new tests for any behaviour
   you introduce or change.

4. Run the full test suite before pushing:
   ```sh
   dotnet test -c Release
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request against `main`.

---

## Coding Standards

All standards are enforced automatically by the build:

- **Nullable reference types** are enabled (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`) —
  no nullable warnings are accepted.
- **Warnings as errors** — the build fails on any warning.
- **`.editorconfig`** — code style (indentation, naming, var usage, etc.) is
  enforced at build time via `<EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>true</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>`.
- **XML doc comments** are required on all public members.
- **Input validation** — every public API method that takes user-supplied
  arguments must guard them with the appropriate
  `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`, `ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrWhiteSpace`,
  or `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIfNegative/ThrowIfNegativeOrZero` call
  (all available since .NET 8).
- **No third-party dependencies** in the library project — TerraPDF has zero
  runtime dependencies and this must remain true.

---

## Tests

Tests live in `tests/TerraPDF.Tests/` and use **xUnit**.

| File | What it tests |
|------|---------------|
| `DocumentGenerationTests.cs` | Integration — produces valid PDF bytes |
| `FontMetricsTests.cs` | Unit — glyph-width accuracy against Adobe AFM values |
| `TextStyleTests.cs` | Unit — `TextStyle` immutability and merge logic |
| `ValidationTests.cs` | Unit — every public method throws the right exception on bad input |
| `BehaviourTests.cs` | Integration — layout, formatting, decorator, and component behaviour |
| `HighPriorityFeatureTests.cs` | Integration — underline, line-height, hyperlink, per-edge borders |
| `RoundedBorderTests.cs` | Unit/Integration — `RoundedBorder` and `RoundedBox` geometry and validation |
| `PageBreakTests.cs` | Integration — explicit page-break positioning |
| `HeaderFirstPageOnlyTests.cs` | Integration — conditional first-page-only header rendering |

### Running with coverage

```sh
dotnet test -c Release --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Coverage reports (Cobertura XML) are written to `TestResults/`.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Fill in the PR template with a clear description of what changed and why.
- Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #42`).
- All CI checks must pass before a review is requested.
- At least one maintainer approval is required before merging.

---

## Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraPDF/issues) and include:

- TerraPDF version
- .NET runtime version
- A minimal reproducible code snippet
- The expected vs. actual behaviour

---

## Suggesting Features

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sahebansari/TerraPDF/issues) with the
label `enhancement`. Describe the use-case, not just the solution.

---

## Release Process

1. Bump `<Version>` in `src/TerraPDF/TerraPDF.csproj`.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` — move items from `[Unreleased]` to a new versioned section.
3. Commit and push to `main`.
4. Wait for CI to go green (build-and-test + pack dry-run must pass)
5. Create a GitHub Release with a tag matching the version (e.g. `v1.3.0`).
   - The `publish.yml` workflow automatically packs and pushes the `.nupkg`
   and `.snupkg` (symbols) to nuget.org.
6. Verify on nuget.org.

---

## Renewing the API Key

nuget.org API keys expire. Before expiry:

1. Sign in to nuget.org → **API Keys** → **Edit** → **Regenerate**.
2. Copy the new key.
3. Update the `NUGET_API_KEY` GitHub secret (Settings → Secrets → Actions).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Workflow fails: "tag does not match csproj version" | Ensure the GitHub Release tag (e.g. `v1.3.0`) matches `<Version>1.3.0</Version>` in the csproj exactly. |
| `403 Forbidden` from nuget.org | API key expired or has insufficient scope. Regenerate and update the secret. |
| Package visible but README is blank on nuget.org | Verify `README.md` is included via `<PackageReadmeFile>README.md</PackageReadmeFile>` and the `<None Include=... Pack="true">` item. |
| Source Link warning locally | Expected when building outside a git repo. The warning disappears on GitHub Actions where `fetch-depth: 0` is used. |
| Old `.nupkg` in `artifacts/` | The folder is gitignored. Delete it with `Remove-Item artifacts/ -Recurse` before a fresh pack. |
